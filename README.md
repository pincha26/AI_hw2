Guidelines
This is a programming assignment. You will be provided sample inputs and outputs (see below). Please
understand that the goal of the samples is to check that you can correctly parse the problem definitions, and
generate a correctly formatted output. The samples are very simple and it should not be assumed that if your
program works on the samples it will work on all test cases. There will be more complex test cases and it is
your task to make sure that your program will work correctly on any valid input. You are encouraged to try
your own test cases to check how your program would behave in some complex special case that you might
think of. Since each homework is checked via an automated A.I. script, your output should match the
example format exactly. Failure to do so will most certainly cost some points. The output format is simple and
examples are provided. You should upload and test your code on vocareum.com, and you will submit it there.
You may use any of the programming languages provided by vocareum.com.

Once upon a time, Los Angeles was a Never Never Land.		People were blissfully happy, Conan O'Brien was still
on late-night, and no one knew who “the Real Housewives of New Jersey” were.	 	 Until the day that two
violent, money-thirsty gangs decided to put their dirty hands onto Los Angeles.		
One gang was from the north, and the other gang was from the south.		Both wanted to take over the entire
city.		Therefore, war was unavoidable.		To win the war, the leader of the south gang knew that he needed not
mere foot troops, but admirals.		Therefore, he built an institute to train his future admirals.		He named his
training institute CSCI-561, and asked his recruits to create artificial agents to engage in a combat simulation,
which he called a 'game', meant to imitate the upcoming gang war.		
(Once the members are finished, the leader will classify their research and pull them from the institute,
leaving them fractured and bitter human beings.	 	However, as they do not know this yet, they are full of
excitement and zeal for the project.)
